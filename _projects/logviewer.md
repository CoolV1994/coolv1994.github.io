Now, you can simplify that process.

Each line is separated into an appropriate tab.

The server tab shows things like Plugin output and misc server output.

Each person is assigned a color, so each time they say something they have a unique color. Players can also have a permanent color set.

Commands can also be colorized.

# Features:

Server logs will be sorted into the tabs you choose based on the rules you set.

All those annoying color codes will be parsed and the text will be shown in its original color.

You can also have text colorized by the user who said it.

There is an optional player list to show you who has been online.

Looking for a specific bit of text? Use the search function to find what you're looking for.

You can also open multiple logs at the same time and connect to multiple servers simultaneously.

Want to live monitor your server? Copy the Log Viewer.jar to that server and have a secure remote connection.

You can also live monitor a server running on your PC.

Can't extract .tar.gz files? No problem, the Log Viewer includes a Gzip extractor.

Works with any server. Spigot, Bukkit, BungeeCord, Vanilla, Forge, Cauldron, KCauldron, Sponge, and Custom Servers
Your server does not even have to be Java based.
